Other needed NPC Commands To do FIRST
/createfaction (Name of Faction) (0 neutral, -1500 to attack)

CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE CREATED ITEMS AND LEARNED TO SPAWN IN YOUR MOBS! NOW TO GO MAKE A BOSS >ðŸ˜Š
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS CREATION
Making a boss is basically the same as making an NPC. Please see the NPC creation section and return here for further instruction <3

Now you have your mob created. You are going to want to do /editnpc (NPC ID)

This will bring up all those lovely options that you are able to play around with. Some of the things you are going to want to do for your boss is:
/editnpc (NPC ID) heroic true
/editnpc (NPC ID) boss true

/editnpc (NPC ID) respawntime (time in seconds)
(( Respawn time is also something you will want to set on your boss. This will set how long it takes for it to spawn in (1800 is 30 minutes for Bosses) to do this you will want to do  ))

If you need to put a boss to the side, for example if it is an event type NPC like Sunta, then you want to do /editnpc (NPC ID) disabled true.
((False means it is here, True means it is technically still in the world, but is not active or visible ex: Sunta is set to True unless we are using him.))

These commands are a few that you will want to do for your boss. However, there are a great many more that you will want to do as well or perhaps not do. Such as Summon ect.

Please keep in mind when making your bosses that our players are stronger than you make think <3

NOW LETS GIVE THAT BOSS A CUSTOM ITEM! REMEMBER THIS CAN BE A WEAPON, ARMOR, OR AN ITEM. WE WILL USE A SWORD AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE STEPS TO TAKE ðŸ˜Š

Creating Custom Items
Spawn in an item such as an IRON sword and hold it in your hand
*You can do this by being in creative mode to make it simple. /gmc*

/createitem 
This will give you an Item ID. KEEP TRACK OF YOUR ID!

/edititem (ID)
This will bring up your list of things you are able to do to your item. Remember always do /edititem (Item ID) (What you wish to edit) (ectâ€¦.. ) when doing a command. And always be careful as to what ITEM ID or LOOT DROP ID you are putting in <3

Now you want to set the level to your item. So look in your list after doing /edititem (ITEM ID) to find where it is listed and how it is spelled <3

Next is the fun part! Follow the link below and pick out â€˜skinâ€™ for your weapon if that is what you are making. Keep in mind if you are making a sword, or bow, the skin must state below it that it is for a sword, bow, axe, ect. 
https://ravand.org//refsheet_tools.html 
Once you know the skin you wish to use, do the following :

/edititem (ITEM ID) display (Name of the skin on the site, and then what you wish to name it.)
((  EX: /edititem 1254 display Bronze Longsword of the Huntress ))

Now lets set a price to it:
/edititem (ItemID) worth (numerical value)

Something else you will want to do, especially if the item is able to be placed is to set the placeable to false. By doing this, the item wont mistakenly be placed and in turn destroyed:
/edititem (ITEM ID) placeable false

Now you want to do the stats. This is a guide for giving the appropriate bonuses, listed below the coordinating command:
+1 damage/4 lvl 
+1 stat/2 lvl
+20hp/Tier
+20mana/Tier

Be sure to pay attention to if the bonus is being based off of the TIER or the LEVEL. <3

Pick two- three resists (+2 bonus per tier) EX (FR + Fireresist, use the whole word)

ALMOST DONE! JUST HANG IN THERE A LITTLE LONGER, YOUâ€™VE GOT THIS!

FOCUS EFFECTS FOR CUSTOM WEAPONS:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=1&mid=1458079337208885879
Go through list and find the one you want. Click on it.
Under the description of the focus click on the focus Link
*ex. Focus:Extended Enhancement lll*
This will bring you to a new list under that link. IGNORE THEM. Go to your web browser and copy the last four numbers in the web link
/edititem (ItemID) focuseffectid (Web site last four numbers)

SKILLMODS:
(only put on 50 lvl items and above)

/edititem (itemID) skillmodtype (Type ex:Abjuration) 
/edititem (ItemID) skillmodvalue (Numerical value generally +1/3 lvl)


identify message
 (If someone identifies the item. You do not have to do this, but it is a fun little thing to add for the benefit of players)
/edititem (itemID) identifymessege (messege)

Allowed Class names
 (This will set it so that only certain classes may use the weapon. Doing multiple classes be sure it is all in Caps with Commaâ€™s and NO SPACES)
/edititem (ItemID) allowedclassnames (DRUID,CLERIC,SHAMAN)
ONCE you have your item all created, even the things we did not go over here, you can now add the item to your Boss to be dropped.

Add item to drop list
/addlootdropitem (LOOT DROP ID*from mob*) (ITEM ID) (count 1) (False) (chance 100%)

Then do /editlootdrop (lootdropid) To make sure that the new item has been added to the loot drop


If you are making Jewelry items be sure to put in where it belongs to be equipped

If you have discovered the item, go ahead and clear your name out so a player may discover it by doing the follow command:

/edititem (item id ) cleardiscoverer true

When making your custom items, keep in mind that Artifacts only ever drop once.





YOU SURVIVED!! CONGRATULATIONS!! ONLY A MILLION MORE THINGS TO LEARN! ^_^
